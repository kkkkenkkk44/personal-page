Hello, I am Chun-Chih (Ken) Yang. I major in Information Management at National Taiwan University. I am fascinated by games and machine learning techniques so I want to further research related fields. In addition, I also enjoy playing basketball with my friends in my leisure time. Thanks for having me!
